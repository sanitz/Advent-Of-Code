**Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. There's **a puzzle** each day with **two parts**. For each part you resolve, you get one **one star**, so by the end of the 25 days, if you do all the 25 puzzles with both parts you get **50 stars**.


## My story this year 💻

*Last year*, when I first heard about **Advent of Code** I've only done the first 7 days and even out of those, two of them I only finished the first part of, ending up with a total of *12 stars*.

This year, after finishing university, I started working full time. But I still wanted to keep my promise of getting _at least 25 stars_. It was very hard to keep to that promise with busy schedule but **I succeeded 🎉**. Out of the 25 days, I finished most of them with **2 stars(16/25)**. The only challange I havent had time to do at all was *day 24*. Three other days I did not get any star for. Days 15 and 17 work on the example input, there are some edge cases which I found when it comes to the actual input but I just dont have enough time to debug right now. Day 20 I haven't finished either because even tho the **regex** algorithm I wrote for it works, its way too slow on the real input. And we are talking hours here. So there was no reason to finish that challange before optimising the regex code first. You could still find these "not finished days" here in this repo.

### What I ended up with

![My progress in 2018](https://i.imgur.com/pQcfz6A.png)

- I worked on **24 out of the 25 days**. Only missed *day 24* 😣.
- Out of those 24 (which you can find here on this github repo) **21 worked**.
- Out of those 21 that worked, **16 gave me two stars**.
- I ended up with a total of **37 stars** this year!

### What I wanted
The goal of each day for me was not to do it in the fastest manner or to have the cleanest or most optimised code, but rather to get it working and have the logic behind of it understood. That's why this might not be the cleanest **C++** code you've seen to date 😬





#### See you next year! 👋🏻
